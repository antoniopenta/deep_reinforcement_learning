From a terminal, navigate to the location where you stored your .pem file. (
For example, if you put your .pem file on your Desktop, cd ~/Desktop/ will move you to the correct directory.)

Type ssh -i YourKeyName.pem ubuntu@X.X.X.X, where:

X.X.X.X is the IPv4 Public IP found in AWS, and
YourKeyName.pem is the name of your .pem file.

Note that if you've used a different AMI or specified a username, ubuntu will be replaced with the username, such as ec2-user for some Amazon AMI's.

You would then instead enter ssh -i YourKeyName.pem ec2-user@X.X.X.X

Configure Jupyter notebook settings

In your instance, in order to create a config file for your Jupyter notebook settings,
type (in AWS): jupyter notebook --generate-config

Then, to change the IP address config setting for notebooks (this is just a fancy one-line command to perform an exact string match replacement; you could do the same thing manually using vi/vim/nano/etc.),
type (in AWS): sed -ie "s/#c.NotebookApp.ip = 'localhost'/#c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'/g" ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

On the EC2 instance
Clone a GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/udacity/aind2-cnn.git
Enter the repo directory
cd aind2-cnn
Install the requirements
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-gpu.txt
Start Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser
From your local machine
You will need the token generated by your jupyter notebook to access it. On your instance terminal, there will be the following line: Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time, to login with a token:. Copy everything starting with the :8888/?token=.
Access the Jupyter notebook index from your web browser by visiting: X.X.X.X:8888/?token=... (where X.X.X.X is the IP address of your EC2 instance and everything starting with :8888/?token= is what you just copied).
Click on "mnist_mlp" to enter the folder, and select the "mnist_mlp.ipynb" notebook.
Run each cell in the notebook.
