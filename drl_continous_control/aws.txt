From a terminal, navigate to the location where you stored your .pem file. (
For example, if you put your .pem file on your Desktop, cd ~/Desktop/ will move you to the correct directory.)

Type ssh -i YourKeyName.pem ubuntu@X.X.X.X, where:

X.X.X.X is the IPv4 Public IP found in AWS, and
YourKeyName.pem is the name of your .pem file.

Note that if you've used a different AMI or specified a username, ubuntu will be replaced with the username, such as ec2-user for some Amazon AMI's.

You would then instead enter ssh -i YourKeyName.pem ec2-user@X.X.X.X

Configure Jupyter notebook settings

In your instance, in order to create a config file for your Jupyter notebook settings,
type (in AWS): jupyter notebook --generate-config.

Then, to change the IP address config setting for notebooks (this is just a fancy one-line command to perform an exact string match replacement; you could do the same thing manually using vi/vim/nano/etc.),
type (in AWS): sed -ie "s/#c.NotebookApp.ip = 'localhost'/#c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'/g" ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

Then run jupyter in AWS:
type (in AWS): jupyter notebook

Then, you can run locally your jupyter using the ip address and the toaken that you will get from the last step.
